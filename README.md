# Logistic Regression for Binary Classification with Decision Boundary Visualization

This project implements logistic regression for binary classification using a dataset containing exam scores and admission decisions. It includes full preprocessing, model training, performance evaluation, and decision boundary visualization to better understand how the model separates the two classes.

## Project Overview

- Visualizes the dataset with admitted vs. not admitted points
- Splits the dataset into training and testing sets
- Applies feature scaling for improved convergence
- Trains a logistic regression model with regularization
- Evaluates the model using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- Plots the decision boundary on a 2D plane to illustrate the classifier's behavior

## Technologies Used

- Python 
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Binary classification using logistic regression
- Data visualization and interpretation
- Feature standardization using `StandardScaler`
- Model evaluation with classification metrics
- Plotting decision boundaries
